#We used the following parameters for running the analyses on infomap online. 


  Infomap v1.3.0 
  Input network: MCI.net
  Output path:   ./
    
## To examine communities across weighted thresholds, enter desired threshold 
##e.g.for 0.5 threshold where links below  weight of 0.5 will be ignored
--c MCI.net
--weight-threshold 0.5
--o tree,ftree,clu      
--clu-level -1
--output clu
-- num-trials = 100
-- core-loop-limit = 1000
                 
#These parameters were selected based on recommendations from both Feckzo and based on infomap documentation. 
#If one opts to run the analyses online, one would need to upload each individual matrix file separately, select the parameters, and then save all output.
#Analyses can be run using stand-alone simple_infomap.py. We would recommend users download infomap from either https://www.mapequation.org/infomap/
# or https://github.com/mapequation/infomap if they wish to run the stand alone version on their personal computer.

#example useage when running infomap from command line with python
